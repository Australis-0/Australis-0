## Heyya! I'm Australis. 
If you're seeing this message currently, maybe you'd like to collaborate on some of my projects I keep around. I dunno, I work on them from time to time.

I work primarily with Node.js/Electron and Java, but I also know C .. so uhh, yeah. I'm trying to complete some of my older projects that I still have from a while ago. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me, you can contact me over Discord at @Australis#6709.

## About Me

.. oh no. Outdated. hm.

Got into programming thru MC plugins, might upload some of them in the future. Odd way, I know, I don't really know what I'm doing here any more than you do.
