## Heyya! I'm Australis. 
If you're seeing this message currently, maybe you'd like to collaborate on some of my projects I keep around. I dunno, I work on them from time to time.

I work primarily with Node.js/Electron and Java, but I also know C .. so uhh, yeah. I'm trying to complete some of my older projects that I still have from a while ago. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me, you can contact me over Discord at @Australis#6709.

## About Me

I'm from Cali! SoCal's been my home my whole life. I was born in LA, but I live in San Diego, just north of the border now after moving around Orange and Riverside counties, pretty much lived everywhere between LA and San Diego.

Got into programming thru MC plugins, might upload some of them in the future. Odd way, I know, I don't really know what I'm doing here any more than you do.
